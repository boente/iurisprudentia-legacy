Jahrhunderts. Als solcher publizierte er unter anderem die Rechtsquellen der Kantone Wallis und Tessin in der von ihm mitherausgegebenen Zeitschrift für Schweizerisches Recht. Er blieb zeitlebens Professor für Rechtsgeschichte, Zivilrecht und Zivilprozessrecht an der Universität Basel. Daneben amtete er als Präsident zuerst des Zivilgerichts und dann des Appellationsgerichtes des Kantons Basel-Stadt. In dieser Eigenschaft schuf er die Basler Zivilprozessordnung die bis zur eidgenössischen Zivilprozessordnung in Kraft blieb. Er war auch ein Experte auf dem Gebiet des Schuldbetreibungsrechtes, schuf daher den ersten Entwurf eines eidgenössischen SchKG, der aber auf den Widerstand der französischsprachigen Kantone stiess, sodass das Gesetz selbst nicht mehr von ihm stammt. Zusammen mit Johannes Schnell und Eduard Thurneysen schuf er den Basler Zivilgesetzentwurf, der nie Gesetz wurde: Dagegen war er massgebend an der Ausarbeitung des schweizerischen Obligationenrechts von 1881 beteiligt."

Jahrhundert – von wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen – praktisch nicht zu Gesicht bekommen, geschweige auf ihren wissenschaftlichen Gehalt hin auswerten konnte. Eine der wenigen Ausnahmen war im Jahre 1998 die von Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Okko Behrends besorgte Transkription, Herausgabe und Kommentierung der für das Wissenschafts- und Rechtsverständnis Jherings so wichtigen Wiener Antrittsvorlesung vom 16. Oktober 1868 zum Thema «Ist die Jurisprudenz eine Wissenschaft?». Allein die beiden Jahresdaten 1868 und 1998, die die Dauer des Dornröschenschlafs dieses nach genau 130 Jahren glücklich, aber viel zu spät gehobenen Schatzes aus dem Göttinger wissenschaftlichen Nachlass markieren, belegen das ganze Dilemma der Handschriftenedition im Allgemeinen."

C.-E. Mecke, Rudolf von Jhering. Anonym publizierte Frühschriften und unveröffentlichte Handschriften aus seinem Nachlaß, Göttingen 2010, S. 150 Fn. 425). Die Folge war und ist, dass Jherings Handschriften bis heute nur ganz sporadisch zur wissenschaftlichen Auswertung herangezogen wurden. Hergebrachte Transkriptionen sind nicht nur ungeheuer zeitaufwändig, sondern auch allenfalls punktuell finanzierbar – zumal in Zeiten des Drittmittelwesens."
          ],

            "Das erstgenannte Manko lässt sich im Informationszeitalter des 21. Jahrhunderts vergleichsweise einfach beheben. Die Interessen der Forschung an weltweiter und ständiger Zugänglichkeit der Handschriften und die tendenziell gegenläufigen konservatorischen Interessen an möglichst wenigen physischen Zugriffen auf die Originale lassen sich durch die Anfertigung von Digitalisaten und deren Zugänglichmachung im World Wide Web auf fast schon einfache Weise zum Austrag bringen. Daher bildet auch die erste Säule des Projekts EditionJhering die Anfertigung und Sammlung von Digitalisaten seiner (Hand-)Schriften, die auf der Plattform nach und nach zentral und weltweit greifbar sein sollen."

Nicht die annähernd fehlerfreie endgültige Transkription von menschlicher Hand steht am Anfang, sondern die noch – zu Beginn sogar stark – fehlerhaltige vorläufige Transkription durch die Maschine. Die Maschine kann und soll den Menschen nicht ersetzen, aber sie soll – mit durch händische Korrekturen zunehmend optimierten Erkennungsmodellen – den ersten Schritt auf dem Weg zur weltweit zugänglichen Erschließung der Schriften tun. Ein Grossteil der vorhandenen Dokumente wurde daher ausschließlich maschinell transkribiert."

Im Ergebnis entwickelten sie ein Mischsystem, das die besten Lösungen der damals geltenden ausländischen Gesetzbücher mit den modernsten Strömungen der Rechtswissenschaft vereinigte. Das hochbewertete Rezeptionspotenzial des polnischen OGB wurde bedauerlicherweise 1939 durch den Kriegsausbruch gehemmt."
